# 📚 Library Management System (MERN Stack)

A **Library Management Web Application** built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.  
This project was developed as part of my **MERN Stack Internship at ICT Academy**.  
It helped me gain hands-on experience with **CRUD operations**, **API integration**, and full-stack web development concepts.
